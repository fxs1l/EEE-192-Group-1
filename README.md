Notes:

Since we had a master node, we coded collaboratively since we had additional components like LoRa, ESP, and LCD in order to sync with the sensor nodes. This explains why we only have one codebase and just changed settings based on variables like

isMaster and sensor

However for interfacing the sensors, the coding task was divided into the following:

- Accelerometer : Asil Andrei Acasio
- Moisture : Rondel Bautista
- Vibration : Roberto Alfonso Naval
